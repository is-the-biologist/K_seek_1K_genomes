# k Seek analysis of the 1,000 genomes project short-read data

This repo contains various analysis scripts used to analyze the downstream results of k-Seek run on the short-reads of 1K genome data. Primarily, we have scripts for quantification and normalization of the k-seek data (KMER_QUANT) and scripts for the inference and analysis of higher order structures (HOR_ANALYSIS).

The KMER_QUANT scripts are simple script for taking in inputs from our k-seek outputs then merging their data and normalizing by depth | %GC of k-mers.
